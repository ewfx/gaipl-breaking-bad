## 🎯 Introduction
The project uses the GenAI model to take data - IT tickets or logs or any text as input and would output them grouped into categories. This can be used to 
- identify unknown labels/categories for IT Tickets
- tag any category/group for log entries to detect neighborhoods.

## 🎥 Demo
Included in PDF files within artifacts folder 

## 💡 Inspiration
Proper tagging/identification of data category is the most important requirement and aspect for any AI/ML related work

## ⚙️ What It Does
I uses BerTopic model to identify the topics within data

## 🛠️ How We Built It
We used NLP & Topic Modeling techniques to build this project using Google colab environment

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
Data quality from open source required preprocessing 

## 🏃 How to Run
Run the ipynb file on any supporting environment

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- Python
